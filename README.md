# PitchDetectionGame

This is a pitch detection game I made using Processing and the Pd4P3 library. There will be circles floating around the screen. If you hover over the circles, you will hear a sound. On the top of the screen, you can see your points, the key, the level, and the number of lives you have. You need to click on the circles that fit in the key that is displayed. If you click a correct circle, you will get one point. If you click a wrong circle, you will lose one point and lose one life. If you get all seven notes correct and still have lives left, you will move on to the next level. You need to beat three levels to win. If you lose all five lives, you lose. 
You will only be able to hear one pitch at a time. In other words, if you are hovering over multiple circles, you may want to wait until they separate before clicking. There are 12 keys and they are all major scales. Each circle is assigned a pitch in the beginning, and itâ€™s changed each time a new key is chosen.
